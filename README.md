# Operation: HotBod

My weight has fluctuated over the years, from the 230s down to the 160s, and despite my best efforts at the time, I was only ever able to achieve a moderately 
muscular physique. 

_HotBod_ is an experiment to see if I can craft my dream body using scientific literature and data science notebooks.

## Brief
If you're interested in replicating or following this project, it'll help to know the methods and tools I'm using:

### Tools
- Anaconda: used for setting up my Python dev environment
- Jupyter Notebooks: used for analyzing data
- FitBod (iOS App): used for crafting routines and tracking strength workout metrics; data exports nicely to a csv
- Apple Watch (w/ iOS Fitness app): used for tracking caloric burn (both active and BMR)
- Lifesum (iOS App): used for tracking macros and caloric intake

### Methods

#### Research
There are a lot of bros out there who'll tell you, "you can't get jacked and lose fat at the same time", to which I'd respond by throwing a meta analysis of fat loss and muscle gain studies at them.
You _can_, and arguably **should**, strive for body recomposition rather than a bulk/cut dietary approach. I learned this through studies that were recommended and
further analyzed in video content produced by Jeff Nippard, an experienced lifter and certified personal trainer. 

My method is as follows: I'll watch the video Jeff has produced, take notes on key takeaways, then proceed to locate the papers refereneced by him in his videos
to further read. Typically you can start with the abstract and drill down from there using section headers. But I'm not here to teach you how to read a scientific
paper, I'm here to get jacked.

#### Workout Programs
I build my workout routines using the FitBod app on iOS. I'm able to craft workouts from scratch to fit the parameters defined by scientists as the best way to
stimulate hypertrophy and thus gain size and strength through protein synthesis.

>Typically, if I weren't reading literature, I'd be more reliant on a professional to shape my workout routine. I feel comfortable shaping my own **only because**
>my focus remains soleley on _myofibrillar hypertrophy_, a topic about which I've read plenty and feel confident I can stimulate for myself, sans trainer recommendations.

#### Macros & Nutrition
All nutrition information is captured with Lifesum. Currently no analysis is being done on nutrient intake, but that's bound to change soon.

#### Analysis
For workout analysis, I create a single noteboook per week, and use this to analyze a single workout program (2 weeks). After each program concludes, I'll assess
my progress and make my next program. Each notebook is set up in a way that requries minimal alteration once duplicated and simultaneously encourages sticking to
a program rather than varying to try other muscle movements.

>Sticking to one routine for 2 weeks was a choice made with the goal of building strength in a particular movement as "muscle confusion" has been scientifically
>proven less effective for stimulating hypertrophy consistently.
